# AI-Powered Code Review Agent

An autonomous code review agent that leverages AI to analyze GitHub pull requests (PRs), providing structured feedback on code style, bugs, performance improvements, and best practices. This system processes pull requests asynchronously and interacts with developers via a structured API.

## Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd code-review-agent
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root directory, and specify the following:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=deepseek-coder-v2
```

### Step 3: Build and Start the Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Step 4: Install the deepseek-coder-v2 model in Ollama

make sure you are in the project root directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec ollama ollama run deepseek-coder-v2
```

Make sure the model is installed successfully before conitnuing to the next step.

### Step 5: Test the Setup

After the containers are up and running, test the API using the endpoints described in the API documentation below.

## API Documentation

### 1. POST /analyze-pr

Initiates the code analysis for a specified GitHub pull request (PR).

Request:

-   URL: /analyze-pr
-   Method: POST
-   Body:
    ```json
    {
        "repo_url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
        "pr_number": 123,
        "github_token": "optional_token"
    }
    ```

Response:

-   200 OK

```json
{
    "task_id": "abc123",
    "status": "submitted"
}
```

### 2. GET /status/{task_id}

Checks the status of an analysis task.

Request:

-   URL: /status/{task_id}
-   Method: GET

Response:

-   200 OK

```json
{
    "task_id": "abc123",
    "status": "completed"
}
```

### 3. GET /results/{task_id}

Retrieves the analysis results for a specified task.

Request:

-   URL: /results/{task_id}
-   Method: GET

Response:

-   200 OK

```json
{
    "task_id": "abc123",
    "status": "completed",
    "results": {
        "files": [
            {
                "name": "main.py",
                "issues": [
                    {
                        "type": "style",
                        "line": 15,
                        "description": "Line too long",
                        "suggestion": "Break line into multiple lines"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "bug",
                        "line": 23,
                        "description": "Potential null pointer",
                        "suggestion": "Add null check"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "summary": {
            "total_files": 1,
            "total_issues": 2,
            "critical_issues": 1
        }
    }
}
```

## Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

-   FastAPI for building the REST API: chosen for its speed, async capabilities, and modern design.
-   Celery with Redis as the broker: to handle asynchronous task processing, enabling the system to scale and handle multiple PR analyses simultaneously.
-   Ollama with deepseek-coder-v2 model: to analyze code and provide structured feedback.
-   Docker: containerizes the application for portability and simplified deployment.

## Code Structure

-   Microservice Architecture: Separate services (FastAPI, Celery worker, Redis, Ollama) encapsulated within Docker containers for isolated development and testing.
    Task Asynchrony: Celery processes each code review independently, allowing efficient use of resources and scalability.

## Analysis Granularity

The agent provides insights into various code aspects (style, bugs, performance, best practices), allowing developers to receive comprehensive feedback. It fetches each fileâ€™s content in a pull request, sending them to the AI model for detailed analysis.

## Future Improvements

-   Multi-language support
-   Rate limiting
-   GitHub webhook support
-   Result caching system

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/test_api.py
```
